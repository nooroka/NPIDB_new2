<b>Interaction modemain.py</b> and <b>Interaction_mode3.py</b> calculate interaction mode of structures;<br>
There are some xlsx tables with statistics: in <b> result_table_families_new.xlsx</b>and <b> result_table_families_resolution_new.xlsx </b> the number of structures and the number of domains belonging to families with this interaction class is calculated;<br>
in <b> result_table_domains.xlsx </b>and <b> result_table_domains_resolution.xlsx </b> the number of structures and the number of families belonging to domains with this interaction mode is calculated;<br>
in <b> result_table_struct.xlsx </b>and <b> result_table_structures_resolution.xlsx</b> the number of domains and the number of families belonging to structures with this interaction mode is calculated;<br>
In folders <b>with_resolution</b> and <b>without_resolution</b> there are scripts used in this work. In <b>with_resolution</b> we take into account the resolutions of structures, however in <b>without_resolution</b> we don't.
<b>all_domains.xlsx</b> represents interaction mode and structures for each domain, all_domains_res.xlsx represents the same for domains with the resolution less than 3.0 A.
<b>all_families.xlsx</b> represents interaction class, domains and structures for each familiy, all_families_res.xlsx represents the same for families, that contain domains with the resolution less than 3.0 A.
