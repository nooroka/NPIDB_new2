Some scripts which are taking into account the resolution of structures and the best resolution  of each domain structures
<b>check3.py</b> and <b>uniprotintpfam.py</b> calculate <i> interaction mode </i> of domains and the number of structures belonging to each domain;<br>
 <b>checkfamilies3.py</b> and<b> familiesintpfam.py</b> calculate <i>interaction class</i> of families and the number of structures belonging to each  domain;<br>
<br>
<b>sqlcountcorrone_fam.py</b> - the template for calculating the number of  families for each <i>interaction class</i> (class) <br>
<b>sqlcountcorronedom.py</b> - the template for calculating the number of  domains for each <i>interaction mode</i> (class) <br>
<b>sqlcountcorrone_structs.py</b> - the template for calculating the number of  structures for each <i>interaction mode</i> (class) <br>
<b>tablestructs.py, tablestructs_run.py</b> for each <i>interaction class</i> calculates the number of structures and the number of domains belonging to families with this <i>interaction class</i> <br>
<b>tablestructs.py, tablestructsrun.py</b> for each <i>interaction class</i> calculates the number of structures and the number of domains belonging to families with this <i>interaction class</i> <br>
<b>tablestructsdom.py, tablestructsrundom.py</b> for each <i>interaction mode</i> calculates the number of structures and the number of families belonging to domains with this <i>interaction mode</i> <br>
<b>tablestructs2.py, tablestructsrun2.py</b> for each <i>interaction mode</i>  calculates the number of families and the number of domains belonging to structures with this <i>interaction mode</i> <br>
<b>inter.py</b> calculates the number of <i>interaction modes</i> for structures that need to be changed<br>
<b>interdomains.py</b> calculates the number of <i>interaction modes</i> for  domains that need to be changed<br>
<b>interfamilies.py</b> calculates the number of <i>interaction modes</i> for families that need to be changed<br>
